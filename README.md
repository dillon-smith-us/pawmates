# Pawmates
## Description

For this group project, we built a web app that securely stores and screens puppy owners for the purpose of setting up playdates with other puppy owners.
The motivation for development was to socialize dogs and puppies with other dogs and people, as well as to create new puppy friends for puppy owners around the twin cities.
